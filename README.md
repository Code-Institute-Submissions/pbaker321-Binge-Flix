### ***How to Clone the Repo***

If you want to clone the repository into a local file you can by:

 1. Find the repo in github.
 2. Click the button "code".
 3. Copy the URL by clicking on the clipboard.
 4. In the IDE of your choice open gitbash.
 5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
 6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL copied from Github
 7. Press enter and the local clone will be created.
 8. After opening the folder you should create a new file in the root directory, name it env.py
 9. In env.py you can set your environment variables.  
    ``` import os
      import os

      os.environ.setdefault("IP", "<your value>")
      os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "<your value>")
      os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "<your value>")
      os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "<your value>")
      os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "<your value>")

10. In terminal window of your IDE type: pip3 freeze -- local > requirements.txt
11. In termial window of your IDE type: python app.py > Procfile 

### ***How to Deploy on Heroku***

The website is hosted and deployed by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home).
Everything is deployed from the master branch and updates automatically whenever the branch is updated in GitHub.

Before deploying to Heroku. Please ensure the env.py file, requirements.txt and the procfile have been set up on your local IDE.

1. Log or register into Heroku
2. Go to your dashboard.
3. Click on the "New"  -> "Create new app" button located right under the navbar.
4. Choose a unique name for your app. (Once a name is taken, it cannot be used again.)
5. Choose a region (preferably close to where you are located. I chose Europe).
6. Next you will see the overview page of your app.
7. Click on the "Deploy" button.
8. On "deployment method" connect to github.
9. On "app connected to GitHub" select the appropriate repo.
10. Click on Settings tab.
11. Reveal Config vars.
12. Here we configure the IP, MONGO_DBNAME, MONGO_URI, PORT, SECRET_KEY values (As with the env.py file, these are not not public).
14. Click "Enable Automatic Deploys"
15. Click on "Deploy Branch".
16. Click "View" to launch the app.

:biohazard: Issues
======

* A problem when registering or logging in, there seemed to be connection problems with the database. I realised I used incorrect code for the submit button.

* Building the like button. I was incorrectly using the $inc operator, I had forgotten the qoutation marks. I also had problems with the like counter resetting when a show had been edited. i fixed this with $set before the information that i wanted edited.

* On Mobile the trending page did not look good with all the information. I decided to create a new page with for show details. The trending page will just have the title, Image and posted information.

* Issued with non users or non session users being able to edit and delete by changing the URL. Added safeguards.
