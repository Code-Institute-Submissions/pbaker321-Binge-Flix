# Aquarium Tracker

This is my 3rd Milestone Project for the Code Institute. It is a fully responsive site.

Aquarium Tracker is an App to allow its user's to keep record of one or multiple aquariums.
It will keep information from the aquarium to allow the user to see when the last clean was done,
the last water test results. This user can see this data over a period of time as the data is stored.

The live version can be found here.

## UX

A responsive App. Allowing the user to keep track of cleaning and testing records. The 
user will also have records of stocking levels for their aquariums.

The Wireframes can be found [here](https://balsamiq.cloud/sfaewk0/pyqefrd).

Please note. There is a big change in the wireframes compared to the end result. This happened as i didn't anticipate the difficulty in implementing the original plan.
